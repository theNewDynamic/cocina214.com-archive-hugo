__**Update as of 1:30 pm March 18, 2020**__

As we continue to monitor COVID-19, we have some updates.

The State of Florida, Office of the Governor issued an Executive Order on March 17, 2020 at 1:34 pm. A local Winter Park Police Officer served us this Executive Order yesterday afternoon and we were already in full compliance before the Order was executed.

While we have always adhered to the highest cleanliness and food safety standards, as of March 5, 2020 we had already taken _extra_ safety precautions and measures.

**1. We implemented enhanced protocols for hourly cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, focusing on all high-volume touch areas and other surfaces that our employees and guests come into contact with.**

**2. We re-educated employees and continue to train daily on what they can do to keep themselves and others safe, including frequent hand washing, not touching one’s face, and staying home if they are sick. Although we always have health and safety signs posted, on March 5, 2020 we posted additional CDC specific posters. These extra CDC posters regard COVID-19, How to Stop the Spread of Germs, and How to Wash your Hands. These extra signs were all added on March 5, 2020 in our employee areas and will continue to be posted for the unforeseeable future.**

**3. Although we have a large and spacious restaurant, in an effort to keep our guests safe, we implemented a safe social distancing area of 6 FT between tables. Some tables are now out of service, in order to create a safe area between them.**

In addition, we require that all employee’s temperature be taken and show fever-free before they can enter the Cocina 214 building.

As part of the Executive Order, as a full-service restaurant, we are able to continue to serve liquor, wine and beer at this time. **We continue our _Regular Hours of Operation_. We also offer _Online Ordering_, with the ability to Pick-Up Curbside or to get Catering Delivered (with no delivery fee for items off of our Catering Menu). You can order online here:** [**https://cocina214.com/shop/**](https://cocina214.com/shop/ "https://cocina214.com/shop/")

**If you choose the online order pick-up option, call the restaurant at 407-790-7997 and a Cocina 214 Team Member will bring your order curbside to your car on Welbourne (by the front door) or Center Street (by the bar door).**

The health, safety and well-being of our family, and yours, is always our top priority. We continue to monitor the daily updates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization, the Florida Department of Health and other local health authorities. As we get updates, we will pass along that information. We are in this together and will get through this together. We thank you for your continued support of our small local business.

Thank you,
