Join us for yoga on the beachfront lawn on **Sunday, November 18, 2018 @ 10:00 am**!

Soraya Sanchez from [Dynamic Alignment Yoga](https://www.facebook.com/DynamicAlignmentYoga/) will teach free beginner's yoga from 10-11am. Plan to stay for brunch after class and receive a complimentary mimosa with the purchase of an entree!

This is our Gratitude-Themed class and we thankful for all of our blessings. The class is open to kids, families and friends, so come join us! Yoga will be held on the green space, overlooking the ocean.

Don't forget to bring your yoga mat, a towel, lots of water, and sunscreen.
