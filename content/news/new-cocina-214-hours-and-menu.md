**Our Main Dining Room and Patio are now OPEN!**

* Our Main Dining Room is Open and we are seating at 50% occupancy, with tables 6-feet apart.
* Our Patio is open first-come, first-serve with tables 6-feet apart.
* Or Bar is currently closed.
* Due to the circumstances and our desire to serve as many of our supporters as possible, we have a 2-hour max per reservation. We appreciate your support, your patience and understanding during this time.

**We continue to adhere to the highest cleanliness and food safety standards with _extra_ safety precautions and measures.**

1. We implemented enhanced protocols for hourly cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, focusing on all high-volume touch areas and other surfaces that our employees and guests come into contact with.
2. We require all Employees to perform and pass the "Orlando Health Business Ready Daily Self Screening" before they come to work. When employees arrive for their shift, we take their temperature to ensure they are fever-free.
3. We continue to re-educate and train employees daily on what they can do to keep themselves and others safe, including frequent hand washing, not touching oneâ€™s face, staying home if they are sick, and wearing a face mask while at work.
4. Although we have a large and spacious restaurant, we implemented a safe social distancing area of 6 FT between all tables. Some tables are now out of service, in order to create a safe area between them.
5. For Phase One we have one-time use Menus. [Cocina 214 Menu - New 2020_letter size_final-1.pdf](https://app.forestry.io/sites/kc5rxzgdfuex3a/body-media//uploads/2020/05/07/Cocina 214 Menu - New 2020_letter size_final-1.pdf "Cocina 214 Menu - New 2020_letter size_final-1.pdf")

The health, safety and well-being of our family, and yours, is always our top priority. We continue to monitor the daily updates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), the World Health Organization, the Florida Department of Health and other local health authorities. As we get updates, we will pass along that information. We are in this together and will get through this together. We thank you for your continued support of our small local business.
