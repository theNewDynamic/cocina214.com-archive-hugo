Join us for yoga on the beachfront lawn on **Sunday, December 16, 2018 @ 10:00 am**!

Soraya Sanchez from [Dynamic Alignment Yoga](https://www.facebook.com/DynamicAlignmentYoga/) will teach free beginner's yoga from 10-11am. Plan to stay for brunch after class and receive a complimentary mimosa with the purchase of an entree!

This is our Holiday-Themed class. Feel free to wear festive gear or even an ugly sweater! 

Yoga will be held on the green space, overlooking the ocean. The class is open to kids, families and friends, so come join us! 

Don't forget to bring your yoga mat, a towel and water.
