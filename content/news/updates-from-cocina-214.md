For the past several weeks, we at Cocina 214 have been monitoring COVID-19. Our thoughts are with the world and with everyone impacted during this challenging time. The health, safety and well-being of our family, and yours, is always our top priority. We monitor the daily updates from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and are also working in accordance with the World Health Organization, The Florida Department of Health and other local health authorities.

While we have always adhered to the highest cleanliness and food safety standards, we want to ensure our family of employees, guests and suppliers that we are going above and beyond and taking extra safety precautions and measures.

**1. We have implemented enhanced protocols for hourly cleaning, disinfecting and sanitizing, focusing on all high-volume touch areas and other surfaces that our employees and guests come into contact with.**

**2. We have re-educated employees and continue to train daily on what they can do to keep themselves and others safe, including frequent hand washing, not touching oneâ€™s face, and staying home if they are sick.**

**3. Although we have a large and spacious restaurant, in an effort to keep our guests safe, we have implemented a safe social distancing area between tables. Some tables are now out of service, in order to create a safe area between them.**

We are closely monitoring the situation and will communicate any further changes if they develop.

**At this time, we will continue our _Regular Hours of Operation_. We will also offer _Online Ordering_, with the ability to pick-up curbside or to get catered delivery _(for orders over $125)_.** You can order online here: [https://cocina214.com/shop/](https://cocina214.com/shop/ "https://cocina214.com/shop/")

**If you choose the online order pick-up option, call the restaurant at 407-790-7997 and a Cocina 214 Team Member will bring your order curbside to your car on Welbourne (by the front door) or Center Street (by the bar door).**

We are in this together and will get through this together. We thank you for your support and will do everything in our power to ensure there are no disruptions in our ability to serve you. Thank you for your Continued Support of our Small Local Business these Past 9 Years!

Thank you,
